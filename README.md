## Building

Use Maven to build, test and install Kilim.

### Compile

To compile the source into a jar file simply:

``bash
mvn compile
```

### Test

To exercise the test suite simply:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Examples

To run an example:

```

### Dependencies

#### ASM 4.0

This software depends on the ASM bytecode library (v 4.0). 

If you don't have ASM version 4.0 installed in your ~/.m2 directory you'll
want to install it.  There is a copy in the `libs` directory, to install it
simply do the following:

```bash
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=libs/asm-debug-all-4.0.jar -DgroupId=asm -DartifactId=asm-all -Dversion=4.0 -Dpackaging=jar
```

After which you'll see Maven do some magic resulting in the following:

```bash
/home/you/.m2/repository/asm/asm-all/4.0/asm-all-4.0.jar
/home/you/.m2/repository/asm/asm-all/4.0/asm-all-4.0.jar.lastUpdated
/home/you/.m2/repository/asm/asm-all/4.0/asm-all-4.0.pom
/home/you/.m2/repository/asm/asm-all/4.0/asm-all-4.0.pom.lastUpdated
```

#### Java 7 (1.7.x)

This library has been ported to Java 7.  It's now "Write once, run on JDK7 only."
